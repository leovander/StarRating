Star Rating
=

This is just a CSS and Jquery implementation of star ratings as seen on sites like Netflix, Amazon, and other websites that need items rated.

I needed to create this without having to rely on someone else's code that needed to be included.

There is probably a better way to approach this, but I wanted to get something I can customize on the fly.

Requirements
-

It just requires any version of Jquery. By default I am pointing to the CDN of it at the top of the page.-
